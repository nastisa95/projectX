# When a minute is evenly divisible by three, the clock will say the word "Fizz".
# When a minute is evenly divisible by five, the clock will say the word "Buzz".
# When a minute is evenly divisible by both, the clock will say "Fizz Buzz", with two exceptions:
# On the hour, instead of "Fizz Buzz", the clock door will open, and the cuckoo bird will come out 
# and "Cuckoo" between one and twelve times depending on the hour.
# On the half hour, instead of "Fizz Buzz", the clock door will open, and the cuckoo will come out 
# and "Cuckoo" just once.
